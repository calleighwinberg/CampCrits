## Description

CampCrits uses Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap for design and deployment. Passport.js is used to handle authentication. The application was designed through Colt Steele's bootcamp for Web Development, with added features. CampCrits aims to build an alternative resource that allows users to create and rate their own campgrounds as well as interact with others. The app hosts the production database through MongoDB and is deployed using Render.
